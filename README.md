# Frontend Dashboard

This React app is a dummy application that list products from
`dummyjson.com/products`. It displays a paginated list that you can search through using the product title.
### Installation & Running the App

- Step 1: Install packages using either npm or yarn `npm install` or `yarn`
- Step 2: Run the app using the `dev` script with either `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`

The app should start running on the port `5173`

### Assumptions made:

- Made the UI keeping the dashboard UX in mind which usually focuses on the utility value rather than being fancy
- Implemented search and pagination functionality on the frontend, contrary to how its done in actual projects

### Challenges faced:

- struggled with unit tests as I haven't implemented them before
  - managed to write the tests using AI tools
  - started reading up on tests and how to make them a part my regular development routine
